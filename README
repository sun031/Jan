INSTALLATION
-------------

1) To compile and link the code you first have to set the ROOT variable in the Make_include file which can be found in the directory where you have found this README.

2) Check the compiler and CFLAGS options in the file Make_include and adapt to the system you are using. The default options are set for a the GNU C compiler on a Linux system. A Fortran or g++ compiler is not needed to compile the code. The Makefile has been tested with GNU make. 

3) If the compiler options are set in the Make_include file you can type 

==> Please make sure that SU is compiled without XDR (in $CWPROOT/Makefile.config make sure that XDRFLAG is NOT set). The SU output files of fdelmodc are all base on local IEEE data.

> make clean
> make 

and the Makefile will make:

- FFT library 
- fdelmodc
- utils

The libraries will be placed in the lib/ directory and the executables in the bin/ directory.

To use the executables don't forget to include the pathname in your PATH:

export PATH='path_to_this_directory'/bin:$PATH:
setenv PATH 'path_to_this_directory'/bin:$PATH:

If the compilation has finished without errors and produced an executable called fdelmodc you can run one of the demo programs by running

> ./fdelmodc_plane.scr

in the directory fdelmodc/demo/ 

The demo directory contains scripts which demonstrate the different possibilities of the modeling program. 

To reproduce the Figures shown in the GEOPHYICS manuscript "Finite-difference modeling experiments for seismic interferometry" the scripts in FiguresPaper directory can be used. Please read the README in the FiguresPaper directory for more instructions and guidelines. 

Other make commands which can be useful:

make clean : removes all object files, but leaves libraries and executables
make realclean: removes also object files, libraries and executables.

The latest version of the source code and manual can be found at:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~janth/Software/Software.html

the code is used by many different people and when they request a new option for the code (for example place receivers in a circle) then I will try to implement, test and make it available.
