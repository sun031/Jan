\section{extrap} \label{extrap}

\subsection{General}

Extrap extrapolates (forward or inverse) an input wave-field through a gridded subsurface model. The output is the extrapolated
wave-field at the desired depth, which is controlled by the parameter {\tt zrcv=}. As a special option snapshots {\tt snap=1} and/or beams {\tt beam=1} can be calculated. The snapshots option selects at every depth step the samples at the desired snapshot times. The snapshot option can be used to see how a certain wavefield propagates through a medium. The beam option gives insight how the energy of the wavefield propagates through the medium. 

For most velocity distributions the extrapolation works fine and gives good results. However for large depth steps (defined through the velocity model) and laterally very strong variations the program may give inferior result due to the assumption that within the length of the convolution operator the velocity is assumed to be homogeneous (velocity is taken at the mid-point of the operator).

\subsection{General parameter description}

The data to be extrapolated ({\tt file\_in}) and the gridded subsurface ({\tt file\_vel}) should at least have the same number of
traces. If the number of traces of the subsurface is smaller an error message is the result. If the number of traces is bigger then
the user should position the first receiver of the data in the subsurface grid. This is done by setting the {\tt gx} header value of
the velocty model corresponding to the {\tt gx} header value in the data to be extrapolated. The distance between the traces in both
gathers should be equal. The number of depth steps is controlled with the parameter {\tt zrcv=} and the extrapolation direction is controlled with {\tt mode=}. For inverse extrapolation the complex conjugate of the forward extrapolation operator is taken. The parameter {\tt reverse} extrapolated the data from the deepest level in the velocity model to the lowest level. 

Topography is taken into account by using a velocity model which has zero velocities above the defined topography. In that case the position of the source and receivers is lowered into the velocity model until a non-zero velocity is found. From that depth the extrapolation of that point is started. 

To avoid reflections at the edges of the model the parameter {\tt ntap} can be set. {\tt ntap} indicates the number of points at the edges for which a spatial taper is designed according to: $\exp{(-(0.4*(ntap-ix)/ntap)^2)}$. Choosing {\tt ntap} equal to half of the operator length is an optimimum value.

The parameter {\tt snap=1} gives at the defined snapshot times (with {\tt tsnap1, tsnap2} and {\tt dtsnap}) the extrapolated wave-field. With this option the propagation of the wavefield through the model can be monitored. 

The parameter {\tt beam=1} gives the energy of the extrapolated wave-field at all calculated depth steps. The energy is calculated in the frequency domain for all depth steps according to $E(x,d) = {1 \over nfreq} \sum_{\omega} \|data(x, \omega)\|^{1 \over 2}$. With this option the propagation of the energy through the model can be monitored. 

The receiver spread is defined by coordinates in x ({\tt xrcv, dxrcv}) and z ({\tt zrcv dzrcv}). The parameters {\tt xrcv} and {\tt zrcv} are defined as arrays which interpretation depends on the parameter {\tt lint}. For example if {\tt xrcv=0,3000}, {\tt zrcv=0,0}, {\tt dxrcv=15}, {\tt dzrcv=0} and {\tt lint=1} then between the points (0,0) and (3000,0) the defined receiver positions are calculated by a linear interpolation between the two points with dx=15, which results in an receiver array of 201 receivers ranging from (0,0) to (3000,0). However, if {\tt lint=0} the receivers are only defined at the points (0,0) and (3000,0). One can also use the paremeters {\tt xrcv1, xrcv2} and {\tt zrcv1, zrcv2} to define receiver arrays.

For a more detailed discussion on the different parameters which are related to the extrapolation operator optimization the reader is referred to the description of the program \htmlref{{\bf opercalc}}{opercalc}. The WLSQ operators are described in Thorbecke et al. (2004).

\subsection{Examples}

In the following example a Green's function in a medium is calculated which gives the data we want to extrapolate. By choosing in
{\bf extrap} the options {\tt beam=1} and {\tt conjg=1}, the calculated output shows how the energy is focused to depth position
1000 (the source depth of the input file) and gets defocused again for deeper depth positions. The options {\tt snap=1} and {\tt
conjg=1} show snapshots of the wavefield propagating through the model.

\end{figure}
%

For forward extrapolation of the data through the model the following command can be given (to let the extrapolation stop at a certain depth level use the parameter {\tt zrcv=}):

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
extrap file_in=green.su file_vel=syncline_cp.su verbose=1 mode=-1 zrcv=1200 | suximage 
\end{verbatim}}

Now with cfpmod from surface to depth and then with extrap from depth back to surface:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}

cfpmod file_vel=syncline_cp.su xsrc1=1500 zsrc1=0 zrcv=1200 ntap=30 file_src=ricker.su file_out=deep.su

extrap file_in=deep.su file_vel=syncline_cp.su verbose=1 zrcv=0 zstart=1200 reverse=1 mode=-1 verbose=1 | suximage 

\end{verbatim}}

    \put(7.0,-0.3){\epsfig{file=EPS/extrap_z0.eps,height=6cm}}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Inverse extrapolated wavefields of Green's function placed in the middle of the model of Figure \ref{model} at z=1200 m.
