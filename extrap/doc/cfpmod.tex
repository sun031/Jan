\subsection{General}

Based on the same algorithm as used in the program {\bf extrap}, {\bf cfpmod} calculates pulse responses of sources which are defined in the subsurface. This program is therefore very usefull for the generation of CFP operators. 
\subsection{Parameters}

Via the command-line or in a parameter file: {\tt par=$<$parameter\_file$>$}.

\subsection{General parameter description}

The gridded subsurface ({\tt file\_vel}) which is needed in the caclulation can be made with for example the DELPHI program {\bf makemod}. {\tt file\_int} is defined by the same program. 

The source position(s) are defined by coordinates in x({\tt xsrc1, xsrc2, dxsrc}) and z ({\tt zsrc1, zsrc2, dzsrc}). If {\tt file\_int} is defined then it is also possible to use the parameter {\tt boundary} instead of the z parameters. The interface file ({\tt file\_int}) is used to place the source at the defined boundary (at the defined x position). Every source postition defines one output gather. However if {\tt add=1} the defined source postions are combined to a planar source and only one output gather is calculated.

The receiver spread is defined by coordinates in x ({\tt xrcv, dxrcv}) and z ({\tt zrcv dzrcv}). The parameters {\tt xrcv} and {\tt zrcv} are defined as arrays which interpretation depends on the parameter {\tt lint}. For example if {\tt xrcv=0,3000}, {\tt zrcv=0,0}, {\tt dxrcv=15}, {\tt dzrcv=0} and {\tt lint=1} then between the points (0,0) and (3000,0) the defined receiver positions are calculated by a linear interpolation between the two points with dx=15, which results in an receiver array of 201 receivers ranging from (0,0) to (3000,0). However, if {\tt lint=0} the receivers are only defined at the points (0,0) and (3000,0). One can also use the paremeters {\tt xrcv1, xrcv2} and {\tt zrcv1, zrcv2} to define receiver arrays.
 
Once the spread for the first shot position is defined, the parameter {\tt dxspr} define the movement of the spread for the next shot.  Choosing {\tt dxspr=0} defines a fixed spread modeling.

The parameter {\tt file\_src} defines a source wavelet, however, if this parameter is not defined a wavelet with a flat spectrum and zero phase is used in the program. 
The sources can be extended in the lateral direction by using the parameter {\tt wnx} or {\tt file\_amp}.  If there are more source positions defined (with {\tt zsrc1 $\not=$ zsrc2} and {\tt dzsrc > 0}) the output consists of a number of shot gathers. The source position in the gridded model is chosen at the nearest grid position.

Plane waves are defined by using the parameters {\tt Na}, {\tt amin} and {\tt amax}. Which define the number of plane waves and the minimum and maximum angle respectively. 

For a more detailed discussion on the different parameters which are related to the operator optimization the reader is referred to the description of the program \htmlref{{\bf opercalc}}{opercalc}.

\subsection{Examples}

To run the program a gridded velocity file has to be defined. We use the gridded velocity file (synclin\_cp.su, see Figure
\ref{model}) which can
be found in the demo directory, and a ricker wavelet (ricker.su, see Figure \ref{wave}), which can also be found in the demo directory.

In this gridded subsurface file we want to place a source at depth 1000 m, at x-position 500 and model the response at the surface.
The result is shown in Figure \ref{cfp1} and the command to generate this results is:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
../bin/cfpmod file_vel=syncline_cp.su xsrc1=1000 zsrc1=500 ntap=30 file_src=ricker.su | suximage
\end{verbatim}}
%
\begin{figure}[hb]
  \begin{pspicture}(8,6.5)
    \put(5.0,-0.3){\epsfig{file=EPS/cfpmod_x1000_z500.eps,height=7cm}}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Response of a point source at x=1000 and z=500 m., measured at the surface z=0.  } \label{cfp1}
\end{figure}
%

To calculate 5 plane wave responses, with 5 different angles ranging from -20 to 20,  from the subsurface the following command can be used:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
../bin/cfpmod file_vel=syncline_cp.su xsrc1=1000 zsrc1=1200 ntap=30  \
    file_src=ricker.su Na=5 amin=-20 verbose=1 | suximage
\end{verbatim}}
%
\begin{figure}[hb]
  \begin{pspicture}(8,7)
    \put(-0.55,-0.3){\epsfig{file=EPS/cfpmod_plane.eps,height=7cm}}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Response of 5 plane waves at z=1200 and x=1500 with angles ranging from -20 to 20. } \label{cfp2}
\end{figure}

To model more than one source position use:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
../bin/cfpmod file_vel=syncline_cp.su xsrc1=300 xsrc2=2700 \
    zsrc1=1200 zsrc2=1200 dxsrc=300 file_src=ricker.su \
    ntap=30 verbose=1 | suximage
\end{verbatim}}

and add those together (and do only one modeling step) do

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
../bin/cfpmod file_vel=syncline_cp.su xsrc1=300 xsrc2=2700 \
    zsrc1=1200 zsrc2=1200 dxsrc=300 file_src=ricker.su \
    ntap=30 add=1 verbose=1 | suximage
\end{verbatim}}
%
\begin{figure}[hb]
  \begin{pspicture}(8,6.5)
    \put(5.0,-0.3){\epsfig{file=EPS/cfpmod_add.eps,height=7cm}}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Response of several point sources position at x=[300,2700] and z=1200 m., measured at the surface z=0.  } \label{cfp3}
\end{figure}
%

\subsection{To do}
Using the local reflectivity function (or a source distribution) instead of a pulse.

Better source position definition if the source does not lie on a point defined by the subsurface grid (which is an implementation of a local extrapolation).
